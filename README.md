📌 Project Description

The Medicine Billing System is a software application developed to automate and simplify the billing and inventory management process of a medical store or pharmacy. The system helps in maintaining accurate records of medicines, managing stock levels, generating customer bills, and tracking sales efficiently.

This system allows the admin to add, update, and delete medicine details such as medicine name, batch number, manufacturer, expiry date, price, and quantity. During billing, the system automatically calculates the total amount based on selected medicines, quantities, taxes, and discounts. After each sale, the inventory is updated in real time.

The authentication module ensures secure access by allowing only authorized users to log in. The system also provides alerts for low stock and near-expiry medicines, helping prevent losses and ensuring medicine availability.

A reporting module is included to generate daily, monthly, and yearly sales reports, stock reports, and expired medicine lists. These reports help pharmacy owners analyze business performance and make better decisions.

Overall, the Medicine Billing System improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, enhances customer service, and ensures efficient pharmacy management.
